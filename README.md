# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## This project is a simple webpage designed to organize all of the learning I have accomplished so far in one place. I learned many things along the way, including how to write basic code in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I also learned the basics of how to interact with Github and save projects there.
